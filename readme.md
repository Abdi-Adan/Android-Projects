# Android-Projects

This is a flutter projects repository containing different projects with the aim of testing, learning or exploring new techniques in the flutter framework, dart language and or general programming concepts

The idea is to build fully functional cross-platform mobile apps with special focus on android and a complete backend built with django and django rest framework, I have added the django backend code to the base directory and will make changes to the arrangements of file structure later
